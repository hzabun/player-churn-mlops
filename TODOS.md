- [x] Analyze raw dataset, how is it structured?
- [x] Decide which logs + log_detail_codes should be used (keep it simple for this basic model)
- [x] Decide which raw dataset columns should be used (again, keep it simple for this basic model)
- [x] Apply row/column filtering on a couple CSVs and check reduction in file size and row count
- [x] Apply remaining preprocessing (group session IDs to get session duration and sums of specific logs, e.g. number of quests completed, number of level ups etc.)
- [x] Add raw data validations to preprocessing
- [x] Add tests for preprocessing script
- [x] Implement prefect flow and tasks for preprocessing
- [x] Setup Feast
- [x] Setup CI/CD via GitHub Actions
  - [x] Lints and tests
  - [x] Unit tests for preprocessing script
  - [x] Validate feast features
- [x] Train LightGBM model
- [x] Write unit tests for training script
- [x] Containerize current pipeline (preprocessing, training etc.)
  - [x] Convert scripts to use S3
  - [x] Convert scripts to use k8s Dask clusters
- [ ] Migrate to AWS via Terraform
  - [x] Setup S3 buckets
  - [x] Setup Feast offline (S3) and online (DynamoDB) stores
  - [x] Setup ECR images
  - [x] Setup basic EKS control plane
  - [ ] Test preprocessing pod on EKS cluster
  - [ ] Adjust CI/CD

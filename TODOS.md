- [x] Analyze raw dataset, how is it structured?
- [x] Decide which logs + log_detail_codes should be used (keep it simple for this basic model)
- [x] Decide which raw dataset columns should be used (again, keep it simple for this basic model)
- [x] Apply row/column filtering on a couple CSVs and check reduction in file size and row count
- [x] Apply remaining preprocessing (group session IDs to get session duration and sums of specific logs, e.g. number of quests completed, number of level ups etc.)
- [x] Add raw data validations to preprocessing
- [x] Add tests for preprocessing script
- [x] Implement prefect flow and tasks for preprocessing
- [x] Setup Feast
- [ ] Add triggers in prefect for Feast
- [ ] Setup CI/CD via GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Lints and tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for preprocessing script
  - [ ] Validate feast features

- [x] Analyze raw dataset, how is it structured?
- [ ] Decide which logs + log_detail_codes should be used (keep it simple for this basic model)
- [ ] Analyze how a fraction of raw dataset can be extracted (e.g. 100k rows, or maybe 1M at most)
- [ ] Save the reduced raw dataset for efficient working on this sample model
